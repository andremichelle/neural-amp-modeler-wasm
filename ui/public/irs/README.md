# Impulse Response Files

This directory contains impulse response (IR) files for cabinet simulation and other acoustic modeling in the Neural Amp Modeler WASM.

## Contributing IR Files

We welcome contributions of high-quality impulse response files! These IRs help users shape their tone with cabinet simulations, reverbs, and other acoustic spaces.

### File Specifications

Please ensure your contributions meet the following specifications:

- **Sample Rate**: 48 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 24-bit
- **Channels**: Mono or Stereo
- **Format**: WAV

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your IR file(s) to the `ui/public/irs/` directory
3. Update this README with your contribution details (see Contributors section below)
4. Submit a pull request

### Ideal Content

We're looking for a variety of impulse responses including:

- Guitar cabinet IRs (various speakers and mic positions)
- Bass cabinet IRs
- Reverb spaces (rooms, halls, plates, springs)
- Acoustic spaces
- Creative/experimental IRs

Please use descriptive filenames that indicate what the IR represents (e.g., "Marshall-1960A-SM57.wav" or "Large-Hall-Reverb.wav").

## Contributors

Thank you to everyone who has contributed IR files to this project!
