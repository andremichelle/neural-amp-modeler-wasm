# Neural Amp Models

This directory contains Neural Amp Modeler (NAM) model files for amp and pedal simulation.

## Contributing Model Files

We welcome contributions of high-quality NAM model files! These models expand the sonic palette available to users and showcase different amplifiers, pedals, and other audio gear.

### File Specifications

Please ensure your contributions meet the following specifications:

- **Format**: `.nam` file
- **Architecture**: Standard NAM architecture (WaveNet, LSTM, or ConvNet)
- **Training**: Models should be properly trained and tested for quality
- **Naming**: Use descriptive filenames that indicate the gear being modeled

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your `.nam` model file(s) to the `ui/public/models/` directory
3. Update this README with your contribution details (see Contributors section below)
4. Submit a pull request

### Ideal Content

We're looking for a variety of models including:

- Amplifier models (clean, crunch, lead, high-gain)
- Overdrive and distortion pedals
- Preamp models
- Vintage and modern gear
- Boutique and classic equipment

Please use descriptive filenames that clearly identify what is being modeled (e.g., "Fender-Twin-Reverb.nam" or "Tube-Screamer-TS808.nam").

### Training Guidelines

- Use high-quality training data
- Ensure proper gain staging during capture
- Test your models before submission
- Include a brief description of the gear and settings used

## Contributors

Thank you to everyone who has contributed model files to this project!
